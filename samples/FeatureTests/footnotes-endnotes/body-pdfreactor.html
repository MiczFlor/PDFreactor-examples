<p class="body">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p class="body">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
here', making it look like readable English.</p>
<p class="body">Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use
Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Contrary to
popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
<p class="body">Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
section 1.10.32.</p>
