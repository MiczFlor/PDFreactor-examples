<p class="body-first">Lorem1 It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, " dolor sit
amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
<p class="body">Lorem2 There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
slightly believable.</p>
<p class="body">Lorem3 It is a long established fact that a reader will be
distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
English.</p>
<p class="body">Lorem4 If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you
need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
middle of text.</p>

leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets

from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem

literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
